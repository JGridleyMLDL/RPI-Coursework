4. MEMORY CODING

int p =20;
int *x = &p;

string* y =  new  string[2];			//In order to make a box in the heap, the ‘new’ is required.
*y = “ox”;			//or y[0] = “ox”
*(y+1) = “cat”;		//y[1] = “cat”
y = new string[1];
y[0] = “five”;

int q[3];
q[0] = 1;
q[1] = 3;
q[2] = 2;

int *z = &q[1];



It would not be possible to delete the strings 'ox' and 'cat'. The pointer to y has already
been reset to something else. Therefore, we have a memory leak.
