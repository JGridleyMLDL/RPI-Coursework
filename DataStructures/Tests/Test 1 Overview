//QUESTION 1

1.1
FALSE. ARRAYS ARE REPRESENTED BY A POINTER AND MAY BE DYNAMIC. THEREFORE sizeof() will be constant for all arrays, whether they have 0, 10, or 500 elements. 


1.2
False. An L-Value is used to be placeholder that is assigned to the R-value. 500 is a number
    and a number cannot be assigned to a placeholder, therefore it cannot be an l-value.

1.3
TRUE. THE CODE WILL RUN BECUASE WHEN THE NUMBER Y IS ASSIGNED TO THE VALUE X, IT IS TRUNCATED AND X BECOMES 7, THEREBY RUNNING THROUGH THE IF STATEMENT.

1.4
It would not compile because THE VECTOR TYPES DO NOT MATCH. 


//QUESTION 2
void    char    string  image[x][y] string.size()   5    x+1,y,old_char  x-1, y, old_char    x, y-1, old_char    x, y+1, old_char
image[x][y]
