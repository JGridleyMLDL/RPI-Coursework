Fixing the bugs in Fibonacci:
By. Jared Gridley

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test? What did
you have to do to fix it?

testThrowsIllegalArgumentException: it was a problem with 0 being classified as
 negative, when 0 is nonnegative. So i changed the first iff statement to give
 the error if the number is less than 0.
(n<=0) --> (n<0)


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have
 to do to fix it?

testBaseCase - Failed because of the same reason as
testThrowsIllegalArgumentException. It was considering 0 to be a negative number
so once I changed it to throw an error when it was less than 0, then it fixed
it.


Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you
have to do to fix it?
public void testInductiveCase() - for this I fixed the mathematical logic of
the problem in the first else if, i changed the boolean statement to not
include 2 in automatically returning 1. In the final part, I changed the n+1 to
n-1 for the first fibonacci call, and the - to a + for the operation of the two
fibonacci calls
